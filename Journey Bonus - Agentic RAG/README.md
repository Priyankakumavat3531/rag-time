# Bonus Journey: Agentic RAG

Welcome to the **Bonus Journey: Agentic RAG!** This journey is designed to explore the cutting-edge concept of combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with agentic AI—creating autonomous systems that actively seek out and incorporate new knowledge.

Unlike previous journeys, this one is a bit different. We’re not hosting a dedicated session, but rather collecting all the most relevant and insightful resources to get you started with Agentic RAG. Dive into the materials, experiment with the concepts, and let us know if you’d be interested in a dedicated Office Hour to discuss it further!
