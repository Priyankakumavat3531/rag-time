## 🎥 Session Summary

### 🎥 Why Optimization Matters in AI Retrieval

Scaling AI applications isn’t just about adding more data—it’s about making retrieval faster, smarter, and more cost-effective. Optimizing vector indexes ensures that AI systems can store, retrieve, and process large datasets efficiently while maintaining high-quality responses. Azure AI Search provides powerful techniques like quantization, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), and hybrid search to reduce storage while keeping retrieval performance high.

### 📚 Techniques for Scaling Vector Search

The size and precision of vector embeddings play a major role in AI efficiency. Quantization compresses vector data by reducing precision, cutting storage requirements by up to 96x without severely impacting retrieval accuracy. Dimensionality reduction through MRL further shrinks vector size while retaining meaning. Oversampling and re-scoring help refine results, ensuring AI still delivers high-quality responses even with compressed indexes. Combining these techniques allows developers to optimize for scale without compromising accuracy.
